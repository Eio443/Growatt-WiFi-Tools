This is a set of tools to play with the Growatt WiFi data collection
module.

1. Install Perl if neccessary, add module Data::Hexify .

NOTE: You may need to adjust paths to scripts and files, depending on
your installation.

2. Start proxy server (see also scripts/run_proxy.sh):

   perl growatt_proxy.pl --debug

   make sure it keeps running!

3. In the Growatt WiFi module, set the server to the system running
   the proxy server. A reboot of the module is neccessary.

4. In the directory where the proxy server is running small data files
   will be created:

	   20150702163939.dat

   You can read these with

   perl growatt_data.pl 20150702163939.dat

   This script assumes your version of the Growatt WiFi module is
   2.0.0.0 or higher. If you have a 1.0.0.0 module, pass the
   --version=1 command line option to the script.

5. If you have a collection of data files, for example the data for
   one day, you can generate charts using

   perl growatt_data.pl --csv 20150702*.dat > current.csv
   gnuplot growatt_data.plot

   This will produce a PNG image:

   current_plot0.png - power production, total and per PV

WARNING: Use at your own risk.

Feedback welcome.
