1. Install Perl if necessary, add module Data::Hexify .

NOTE: You may need to adjust paths to scripts and files, depending on
your installation.

2. Start proxy server (see also scripts/run_proxy.sh):

   perl growatt_proxy.pl --debug

   make sure it keeps running!

3. In the Growatt WiFi module, set the server to the system running
   the proxy server. A reboot of the module is necessary.

4. In the directory where the proxy server is running small data files
   will be created:

	   20150702163939.dat

   You can read these with

   perl growatt_data.pl 20150702163939.dat

5. If you have a collection of data files, for example the data for
   one day, you can generate a chart using

   perl growatt_data.pl --plot 20150702*.dat > current_plot.data
   gnuplot --persist growatt_data.plot

Feedback welcome.
